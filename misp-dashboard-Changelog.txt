Fix
~~~
- [userLogin] Do not consider all login as login from the SYSTEM ADMIN
  anymore. [Sami Mokaddem]

  Due to the change in the misp-zmq, `misp_json_user` only contain the

- - Small typo and remove absolute pathing due to "cd" in the beginning
  (not ideal but now good enough) [Steve Clement]
- - After some buggering about, I think this will now finally work -
  bash -c wants to have positional parmeters, anything else is wrong,
  man bash: If the -c option is present, then commands are read from
  string.  If  there  are  arguments after the string, they are assigned
  to the positional parameters, starting with $0. [Steve Clement]
- - Remove set -e, which prevents execution as soon as a process returns
  an exit code != 0. [Steve Clement]
- - Go to misp-dashboard home directory - Add a more sane bash way of
  checking for netstat results. [Steve Clement]
- - Maybe a fix for a very weird bash behaviour… see:
  http://pastebin.lu/ovilikesos.bash. [Steve Clement]
- - Remove DASH_HOME legacy… -- Now more dynamic - Added python venv
  check - Removed necessity of activating the the venv. [Steve Clement]
- - Added very flaky check if something is running on port 6250 --
  Mostly added this because the VM builder already launches a redis on
  port 6250. [Steve Clement]
- - config directory is one up. [Steve Clement]
- - Another typo, closing parenthesis. [Steve Clement]
- - Small typo, one _ missing on each side ;) [Steve Clement]
- - Fixed the brokeness of: -    echo export DASH_CONFIG=$(pwd)/config/
  >> ./DASHENV/bin/activate -- This is mostly wrong for people not
  running misp-dashboard interactively. -- It also assumes people use
  DASHEN as their virtualenv name (One more issue along those lines
  remain, $DASH_HOME) [Steve Clement]

  Clement]

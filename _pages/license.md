# MISP, Overview of the licenses used in the MISP Project (software, libraries and knowledge base)

The MISP project is a large open source project, aiming to support and improve information sharing and threat intelligence analysis at large.

As the MISP project is used in different geographical regions (Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, South America and Africa) as well as different sectors of activities (spanning a wide selection such as cyber security, intelligence community, law enforcement and NGOs), we provide detailed information about the open source licenses used by the various parts of the project.

# Open Source Licenses Used

The MISP sub-projects use different open source licenses depending on the various use-cases for the given software, library or knowledge base. All the open source licenses used are approved by the OSI and classified as Free/Libre by the Free Software Foundation.

# Export control

The MISP Project is developed at an international scale and the core developers are located in Europe. This website is hosted in Belgium. Export restriction might apply (as MISP open source software can be classified as [ECCN 5D002 or 5D992](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/new-encryption/1652-cat-5-part-2-quick-reference-guide/file)) for the users depending on their location if they wish to download MISP from the official GitHub repositories (hosted by GitHub, Inc.). If you are located in a region where downloading from GitHub is restricted, the MISP project provides an alternative git repository for each MISP sub-projects at the following location: [https://eugit.opencloud.lu/MISP](https://eugit.opencloud.lu/MISP) located in Luxembourg, Europe (hosted by [opencloud.lu](https://www.opencloud.lu/)).

## Download and Install MISP

[MISP source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) including documentation and scripts for installation.

[ChangeLog](/Changelog.txt) contains a detailed list of updates for each software release in the core of the MISP software.

MISP Install guides (stock install instructions for getting a base MISP system running) are available at [https://misp.github.io/MISP/](https://misp.github.io/MISP/).

### Requirements

MISP can be easily installed on any standard GNU/Linux distribution. Installation guides for various distributions are included in the [INSTALL directory](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/2.4/INSTALL). If you did a git clone of MISP for the installation, an [UPDATE procedure is available](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/blob/2.4/INSTALL/UPDATE.txt) to keep your MISP up-to-date.

### Virtual images

If you would like to test MISP and don't want to do an installation, CIRCL generates automatically VMware images and VirtualBox at each MISP core commit. Available at the [following location](https://www.circl.lu/misp-images/latest/). The image is to be used for testing purposes only, production-use is considered to be dangerous as is, it contains much more than MISP alone but also misp-dashboard and viper which requires additional security review before being in production.

The default credentials for the automatically generated virtual machines are the following:

~~~~
For the MISP web interface -> admin@admin.test:admin
For the system -> misp:Password1234
Please add the following forwards on your VM Host:

VBoxManage controlvm MISP_VM_NAME natpf1 www,tcp,,8080,,80
VBoxManage controlvm MISP_VM_NAME natpf1 ssh,tcp,,2222,,22
VBoxManage controlvm MISP_VM_NAME natpf1 dashboard,tcp,,8001,,8001
~~~~

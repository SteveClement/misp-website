MISP is not only a software but also a series of data models created by the MISP community. MISP includes a simple and practical information sharing format expressed in JSON that can be used with MISP software or by any other software.

## MISP Core Format

The MISP core format is a simple JSON format used by MISP and other tools to exchange events and attributes. The JSON schema 2.4 is described on the MISP core software and many sample files are available in the OSINT feed.

The MISP format is described as Internet-Draft in [misp-rfc](https://github.com/MISP/MISP-rfc). The MISP format are described to support the developer or organisation willing to build your own tool supporting the MISP format (as import or export). The standard is built from practical use-cases and the implementation references within the MISP project. The standard is quickly evolving following the MISP implementation.

### Categories

*   **Internal reference**: Reference used by the publishing party (e.g. ticket number)
*   **Targeting data**: Targeting information to include recipient email, infected machines, department, and or locations.
*   **Antivirus detection**: List of anti-virus vendors detecting the malware or information on detection performance (e.g. 13/43 or 67%). Attachment with list of detection or link to VirusTotal could be placed here as well.
*   **Payload delivery**: Information about the way the malware payload is initially delivered, for example information about the email or web-site, vulnerability used, originating IP etc. Malware sample itself should be attached here.
*   **Artifacts dropped**: Any artifact (files, registry keys etc.) dropped by the malware or other modifications to the system
*   **Payload installation**: Location where the payload was placed in the system and the way it was installed. For example, a filename|md5 type attribute can be added here like this: c:\windows\system32\malicious.exe|41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.
*   **Persistence mechanism**: Mechanisms used by the malware to start at boot. This could be a registry key, legitimate driver modification, LNK file in startup
*   **Network activity**: Information about network traffic generated by the malware
*   **Payload type**: Information about the final payload(s). Can contain a function of the payload, e.g. keylogger, RAT, or a name if identified, such as Poison Ivy.
*   **Attribution**: Identification of the group, organisation, or country behind the attack
*   **External analysis**: Any other result from additional analysis of the malware like tools output Examples: pdf-parser output, automated sandbox analysis, reverse engineering report.
*   **Financial fraud**: Financial Fraud indicators, for example: IBAN Numbers, BIC codes, Credit card numbers, etc.
*   **Support Tool**: Tools supporting analysis or detection of the event
*   **Social network**: Social networks and platforms
*   **Person**: A human being - natural person
*   **Other**: Attributes that are not part of any other category or are meant to be used as a component in MISP objects in the future

### Types

*   **md5**: You are encouraged to use filename|md5 instead. A checksum in md5 format, only use this if you don't know the correct filename
*   **sha1**: You are encouraged to use filename|sha1 instead. A checksum in sha1 format, only use this if you don't know the correct filename
*   **sha256**: You are encouraged to use filename|sha256 instead. A checksum in sha256 format, only use this if you don't know the correct filename
*   **filename**: Filename
*   **pdb**: Microsoft Program database (PDB) path information
*   **filename|md5**: A filename and an md5 hash separated by a | (no spaces)
*   **filename|sha1**: A filename and an sha1 hash separated by a | (no spaces)
*   **filename|sha256**: A filename and an sha256 hash separated by a | (no spaces)
*   **ip-src**: A source IP address of the attacker
*   **ip-dst**: A destination IP address of the attacker or C&C server. Also set the IDS flag on when this IP is hardcoded in malware
*   **hostname**: A full host/dnsname of an attacker. Also set the IDS flag on when this hostname is hardcoded in malware
*   **domain**: A domain name used in the malware. Use this instead of hostname when the upper domain is important or can be used to create links between events.
*   **domain|ip**: A domain name and its IP address (as found in DNS lookup) separated by a | (no spaces)
*   **email-src**: The email address used to send the malware.

*   **regkey**: Registry key or value
*   **regkey|value**: Registry value + data separated by |
*   **AS**: Autonomous system
*   **snort**: An IDS rule in Snort rule-format. This rule will be automatically rewritten in the NIDS exports.
*   **pattern-in-file**: Pattern in file that identifies the malware
*   **pattern-in-traffic**: Pattern in network traffic that identifies the malware

## MISP objects

MISP objects are in addition to MISP attributes to allow advanced combinations of attributes. The creation of these objects
and their associated attributes are based on real cyber security use-cases and existing practices in information sharing.
MISP objects are standardised under a simple templating format and are automatically available in MISP. A series of relationships
are also defined along with the objects which can be used to create relationships between objects.

The objects available can be [browsed via the web site](/objects.html) or downloaded as [PDF](/objects.pdf) or directly via the MISP software.

## MISP Taxonomies

Along with the core format, [MISP taxonomies](https://www.github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/) provide a set of already defined classifications modeling estimative language, CSIRTs/CERTs classifications, national classifications or threat model classification. The fixed taxonomies provide a practical method to tag efficiently events and attributes within a set of MISP instances where taxonomies can be easily cherry-picked or extended to meet the local requirements of an organization or a specific sharing community. When using MISP, the MISP taxonomies are available and can be freely used based on the community practises.

The taxonomies can be [browsed via the web site](/taxonomies.html) or downloaded as [PDF](/taxonomies.pdf) or via the MISP software.

## MISP Galaxy

MISP galaxy is a simple method to express a large object called cluster that can be attached to MISP events or attributes. A cluster can be composed of one or more elements. Elements are expressed as key-values. There are default vocabularies available in MISP galaxy but those can be overwritten, replaced or updated as you wish. Existing clusters and vocabularies can be used as-is or as a template. MISP distribution can be applied to each cluster to permit a limited or broader distribution scheme. Many MISP galaxy clusters are already available like Exploit-Kit, Microsoft Activity Group actor, Preventive Measure, 
Ransomware, TDS, Threat actor or Tool used by adversaries.

The galaxy can be [browsed via the web site](/galaxy.html) or downloaded as [PDF](/galaxy.pdf) or directly via the MISP software.

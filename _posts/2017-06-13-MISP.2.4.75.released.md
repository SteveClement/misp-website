A new version of MISP [2.4.75](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.75) has been released including bug fixes and a set of performance improvements.

In this release the most important improvement is performance tuning to improve the day-to-day life of the users. The performance improvements are most explicitly on:

- Pagination on events with a lot of attributes has been significantly improved.
- Warning-lists are now stored in the Redis data store which improves the warning-list lookup notably.
- Memory usage of the search API has been drastically reduces

New features were introduced, such as the mass-delete feature in the user-interface on the event index as well as at the API level where a list of event IDs to be deleted can now be posted to the appropriate API.

Multiple improvements in the ZMQ publisher script to support Python 3 including a bug fix to avoid the tearing down of the ZMQ socket for each message published.

Galaxies updated to the latest version including a complete new galaxy for [RAT (Remote Access Trojan) definitions](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp-galaxy/index.html#_rat).

This release also includes bug fixes to the STIX exports where some installations using different versions of the Python libraries would be unable to export events in STIX format.

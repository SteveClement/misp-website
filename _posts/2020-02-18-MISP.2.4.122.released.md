# MISP 2.4.122 released

A new version of MISP ([2.4.122](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.122)) has been released. This version includes various fixes, minor new features and improvements.

# Log user IP addresses on login

A new logging optional feature has been added to log user IPs on login.

The feature logs on successful login logs the associated user ID for a given IP (with a 30 day retention). It also logs the IP for the associated user ID (indefinite retention).

Two new command lines were added:

    - Get IPs For User ID: `MISP/app/Console/cake Admin UserIP [user_id]`
    - Get User ID For User IP: `MISP/app/Console/cake Admin IPUser [ip]`

# New Danish community added

We have a flexible system to announce information sharing communities directly in MISP - in 2.4.122, we have added a Danish MISP user-group community. If you would like to have your community added and announced to all MISP users, don't hesitate to edit the [community JSON file](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/blob/2.4/app/files/community-metadata/defaults.json) and perform a pull-request.

# Correlation bug fixed

A bug fix solves an issue where attribute edits could purge correlations. The bug was introduced by a merge gone wrong. The attribute edits that modify fields that do not affect the correlations (such as to_ids, comment, etc) would cause correlations to be purged

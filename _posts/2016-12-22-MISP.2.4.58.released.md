A new version of MISP [2.4.58](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.58) has been released, including bug fixes and a specific improvement to the correlation feature.

Correlation can be disabled at the instance level, or, if a new setting is enabled, at the event or at the attribute level by a site admin or the creator of the event. The latter is an optional feature that can be enabled or disabled system-wide in MISP. This allows for a flexible scheme, supporting situations where the correlations of certain events or attributes are not interesting for the analysts. This feature is also available via the API.

The release includes various improvements such as:

- [Galaxy] bug fixes and improvement to the UI based on users feedback.
- Fuzzy_Hash_Value export added in STIX/CybOX.
- LDAP authentication improved to get role from LDAP.
- Some minor bug fixes and updates.

A big thanks to all the users who gave feedback and contributors who helped us improve MISP.

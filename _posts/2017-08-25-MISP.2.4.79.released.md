A new version of MISP [2.4.79](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.79) has been released including an important security fix (persistent XSS on comment field), multiple bug fixes and new functionalities.

All the taxonomies actions (including index, view, enable, disable) are now accessible via the API.

The feed previews are now exposed to the API in addition to the graphical user-interface.

Additional command line tool such as enabling/disabling misp or changing baseurl can be done from command line (e.g. easing the automation and deployment of MISP instances at large scales).

Set the current password confirmation requirement for any user profile edits as optional (off by default).

Feeds (caching and updates) can now be updated via the scheduler.

[CVE-2017-13671](https://www.circl.lu/advisory/CVE-2017-13671/) was fixed. A MISP user having access to a MISP instance can inject JavaScript in a discussion comment field, aka XSS.  The comment field is not part of the MISP synchronisation and only impacts the users of the same instance. Thanks to Jurgen Jans and Cedric Van Bockhaven from Deloitte for the security report. 

MISP taxonomies, galaxies (including the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CKâ„¢)) and PyMISP updated to the latest version.

Multiple annoying bugs were fixed in the UI and API including [#2394](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/issues/2394), [#2387](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/issues/2387), [#2381](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/issues/2381).

A new version of MISP ([2.4.108](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.108)) has been released with a host of new features, improvements and bugs fixed. We strongly advise all users to update their MISP installations to this latest version.

# New main features

## A copy-paste-and-sync function

A new tool has been added in MISP to create MISP sync configuration objects in JSON format from the user-interface. This significantly improved the setup of synchronisation links between MISP instances. The synchronisation can now be set up (in addition to the standard setup) in 2 simple steps:

- Use your sync user account on the remote MISP instance to extract the sync config in one click;
- paste the sync config into your own instance as a site-admin user.

That's it, you have the synchronisation configured.

## Improved "paranoid" logging

During the [enforce](https://securitymadein.lu/news/ceis-securitymadein-lu-enforce-project/) training session in Paris, law enforcement officers mentioned the need for LEA to have extensive audit mechanisms in regards to information read and user access in general. A new optional paranoid logging functionality has been added to log any queries from the user-interface and the API of a MISP instance. The feature has two sub-features, allowing administrators to configure their MISPs to log the POST/PUT bodies as well as the ability to force paranoid log entries to skip being stored in the database, instead publish the gathered information exclusively via one of the various pub-sub channels (such as ZMQ, Kafka or ElasticSearch ZMQ, Kafka or ElasticSearch) or via syslog.


## API

- New logical 'AND' for tag filters has been added in restSearch API.
- Added object_relation as a filter for both the event/attribute restSearch functions.
- [restResponse] Added documentation for adding tags on Objects.
- [API] Allow more flexibility on the return content types. [iglocska]

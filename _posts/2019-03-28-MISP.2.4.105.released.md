A new version of MISP ([2.4.105](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.105)) has been released to fix a security vulnerability ([CVE-2019-10254](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-10254)) in addition to some minor improvements and a fix for the STIX 1.1 import, enabling the import of files with additional namespaces (such as [CISCP](https://www.dhs.gov/cisa/cyber-information-sharing-and-collaboration-program-ciscp)).

This release includes a security fix for a reflected XSS ([CVE-2019-10254](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-10254)) vulnerability in the default layout template as reported by Tuscany Internet eXchange - Misp Team - TIX CyberSecurity (Thanks to them!). We strongly recommend that everyone update their MISPs to the latest version.

The STIX 1.1 import can now import STIX files using additional, non-standard namespaces (such as [CISCP](https://www.dhs.gov/cisa/cyber-information-sharing-and-collaboration-program-ciscp)).

# Improvements

- A new diagnostic to display the status of all the git sub-modules.
- Replaced the old non-cached export page with improved restSearch.
- Multiple improvements in the UI.
- Russian translation of the UI added.
- STIX 1.1 export fixed to set the adequate TLP marking.

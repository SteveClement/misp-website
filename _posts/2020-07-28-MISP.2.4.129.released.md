# MISP 2.4.129 released

A new version of MISP ([2.4.129](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.129)) has been released with an improved merge functionality, a new event block rule system, many security fixes and bugs fixed.

# Merge functionality improved

- handle objects, tags, etc via @chrisr3d's module result parsing
- handle sharing groups correctly
- using standardised fetchers internally
- API enabled (which will directly merge all contents of the source event into the target event)

# event block rule system added.

- add simple tag filters to block events from being added.
- it will not stop a manual creation of an event with subsequent adding of the tag in a later stage
- it will however block synced events

# Many bugs fixed and small improvements

Many other improvements are documented in the [complete changelog is available](https://www.misp-project.org/Changelog.txt).

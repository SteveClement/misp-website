# Dashboard and widget improved

The dashboard has been improved along with a host of bugs fixed. A UI for the multiline widget has been introduced.

The new interface provides users a simple way to manipulate basic graph components. It includes legends, tooltips, auto-resize, clickable labels and a full support of the 2 most common x-axis: linear and time-based.

You can query the chart to see the delta between two datapoints by selecting the first then the last points. A summary will then be presented.

Finally, the widget styling is largely configurable. In addition to the `time_format` and the abscissa type, you can define other parameter influencing how the graph should be presented to the users

# (auditing) Individual user monitoring

- Site admins can set the monitoring flag on a user if the feature is enabled on the instance
- Monitored users will have all requests logged along with POST bodies
- Keep in mind this functionality is quite heavy and intrusive - so use it with care. The idea is that this allows us to track potentially malicious users during an investigation

# New community CogSec Collab disinformation

MISP includes the possibility to advertise your MISP information sharing community, don't hesitate to propose your community to gain some visibility. We added "[The Cognitive Security Collaborative operates as a sharing community dedicated to information operations](https://www.misp-project.org/2020/03/26/cogsec-collab-misp-community.html)".

# COVID-19 MISP

COVID-19 MISP is a MISP instance retrofitted for a COVID-19 information sharing community, focusing on two areas of sharing:

- Medical information
- Cyber threats related to / abusing COVID-19

The information sharing community has a low barrier of entry, everyone can contribute and use the data. By default, the information is classified as TLP:WHITE for broader distribution and usefulness.

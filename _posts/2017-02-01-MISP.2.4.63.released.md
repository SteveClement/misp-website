A new version of MISP [2.4.63](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.63) has been released, including bug fixes and new features.

New features in the API:

 - Allowing fetching of full discussion threads via the API.
 - Add and remove tags from objects by uuid (in addition to the id).

Added a new setting to show post count on the event index including a notification if it has a post newer than 24 hours.

A significant update has been done to ensure the pruning of the upgrade logs. A pruning tool is available in server Settings under the diagnostics.
This solves an issue where doing an upgrade from version ~2.4.50 can cause the filling up the database with upgrade script logs.

[MISP galaxy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy) has been updated to the latest version including a new ransomware galaxy and many updates. MISP warning-lists have been updated to the latest version.

A big thanks to all the users who gave feedback and contributors who helped us improve MISP.

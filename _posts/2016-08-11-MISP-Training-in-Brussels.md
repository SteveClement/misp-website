On September 5th 2016 and after 3 successful editions, the MISP (Malware Information and Threat Sharing Platform) training is traveling to Brussels. This workshop is organized by [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/) in collaboration with [CERT-EU](https://cert.europa.eu) and will take place at the European Economic and Social Committee’s premises.

Previous MISP trainings, given by CIRCL, have gathered more than 100 security experts from Luxembourg, France, Belgium, Germany, the UK, Spain, North America and the Netherlands.

MISP is an advanced platform for sharing, storing and correlating Indicators of Compromises (IoCs) from attacks and cybersecurity threats. Today, MISP is used in multiple organizations to store, share, collaborate on malware, and also to use the IoCs to detect and prevent attacks. The aim of this trusted platform is to help improving the countermeasures used against targeted attacks and set up preventive actions. MISP will become a full-feature information and threat sharing platform to support operational and tactical cybersecurity intelligence.

“This 4th MISP training will give us more insight and concrete feedback from the CERT.EU users and community. This will in turn help us keep on improving the platform. As active users of the MISP instances, we are delighted to have CERT-EU’s support and be able to carry out our training outside of Luxembourg”, says Alexandre Dulaunoy, from CIRCL.

The workshop will present the platform and its functionalities and demonstrate how to benefit most from sharing, commenting and contributing on the platform.

- The first part will give a practical overview of MISP and how it could be deployed from a user perspective to support operational cybersecurity intelligence.
- The MISP interfaces and API (Application Program Interface) will also be presented, more precisely how to use and extend MISP to support your information security operational teams using programmatic interfaces. 
- Finally, attention will be given to the future of MISP and how you can contribute to MISP not only as a developer but also as an active user. The speakers will give an extensive presentation of PyMISP, the MISP modules, the taxonomy & tagging and the Viper MISP integration.

"CERT-EU has been an active user and supporter of MISP since five years and we are very pleased of the new features that are being added over time. We are also very pleased with the enthusiastic take up of the platform by the community. We hope that this training will stimulate the increase of threat information exchange between the different stakeholders", says Freddy Dezeure, Head of CERT-EU.

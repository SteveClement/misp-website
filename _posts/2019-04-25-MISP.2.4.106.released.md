A new version of MISP ([2.4.106](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.106)) has been released with a host of improvements, including new features such as a feed cache search, CLI tools to manage your MISP instance along with improved diagnostics.

# New features

- [API] Improved API to update warning-lists, object templates, the galaxy library, taxonomies and notice lists.
- Searching the feed caches is now possible via both the UI and the API. This allows users to rapidly find out whether a provided value exists in any of the cached sources (feeds [feeds](https://www.misp-project.org/feeds/) and MISP servers alike).
- [CLI] Worker management is now exposed via the CLI. The listing, starting, restarting and killing of workers can now be simply accomplished via the CLI.
- [CLI] reset/set a user's API key via the CLI. Overriding a password is now also possible without the need to force a password reset on login.
- [Auth] [LinOTP](https://www.linotp.org/) authentication module added in MISP.
- A [training deployment script](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/blob/2.4/app/Console/Command/TrainingShell.php) has been added to support the deployment of configurable networked MISP training topologies. The script has been created in order to support the NATO locked shields 2019 exercise, especially in regards to the deployment of a large number of connected player-team instances.

# Improvements

- [UI] Thumbnails are now included in the event graph visualisation.
- Exports in all formats are now enabled by default even for non-published events.

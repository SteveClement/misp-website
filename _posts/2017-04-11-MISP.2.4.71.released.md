- **API** restsearch has been significantly improved allowing to support alternate download types from the restsearch (currently OpenIOC is supported). OpenIOC export and CIDR tool refactored.
- Organisation blacklist is now enabled by default and [sample UUIDs/organisations](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/book-convention/) are now blacklisted by default.
- **API** The "proposal to delete flag" is now available in the API output.
- Improved error handling when failing to add a tag.
